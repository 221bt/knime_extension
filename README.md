# EPCIS Synthetic Supply Chain Data Generator KNIME Node

## Overview
This repository contains a KNIME node designed for AI/ML scientists and supply chain analysts to generate synthetic supply chain data compliant with GS1 EPCIS V2 standards. The node enables the creation of realistic, interconnected datasets mimicking food supply chain operations. Generated datasets support forward and backward tracing, network analysis, and compliance with regulatory requirements such as FDA’s FSMA Section 204. The synthetic data is ideal for developing predictive analytics, machine learning models, and anomaly detection systems to enhance traceability, optimize recall management, and ensure food safety during outbreaks.

The node was developed by 221BT as part of its mission to provide innovative solutions for supply chain visibility and efficiency. The dataset’s compliance with GS1 EPCIS V2, validated using NIRA’s Oliot EPCIS X, ensures standardization, interoperability, and regulatory adherence, making it a powerful tool for both research and industry applications.

In addition to its core functionality, this tool unlocks a wide range of use cases, from simulating complex supply chain scenarios to training AI models for emerging challenges. Whether you’re researching supply chain resilience, testing compliance systems, or building predictive models for risk management, this node provides a robust foundation for experimentation and innovation.

## Suitable Use Cases
The EPCIS-based synthetic supply chain data generated by this node can be leveraged in a variety of scenarios, making it an invaluable resource for researchers, analysts, and industry professionals. Here are some key applications:

- **Training Machine Learning Models for Traceability and Recall**: Use the synthetic data to train AI models that can quickly trace products forward (from source to consumer) and backward (from consumer to source) during recalls or outbreaks, minimizing response times and reducing risks.
- **Simulating Supply Chain Disruptions**: Generate data to model disruptions such as natural disasters, geopolitical events, or labor strikes, allowing businesses to test resilience strategies and optimize contingency plans.
- **Compliance Testing and Regulatory Preparedness**: Create datasets to simulate compliance with global standards (e.g., GS1, FDA, EU regulations) and test systems for adherence to traceability mandates, ensuring readiness for audits and inspections.
- **Network Analysis and Optimization**: Analyze the interconnectedness of supply chain networks to identify bottlenecks, vulnerabilities, or opportunities for efficiency improvements, such as reducing waste or shortening lead times.
- **Anomaly Detection for Food Safety**: Develop and test anomaly detection algorithms to identify potential contamination events, spoilage, or tampering in real-time, enhancing food safety and consumer trust.
- **Scenario Planning for Sustainability**: Generate data to evaluate the environmental impact of supply chain decisions, such as carbon footprint reduction or sustainable sourcing, supporting green initiatives and corporate sustainability goals.
- **Training and Education**: Use the node to create realistic training datasets for educational programs, workshops, or certifications in supply chain management, helping students and professionals gain hands-on experience with EPCIS standards.
- **Vendor and Partner Collaboration**: Simulate multi-tier supply chain interactions to test collaboration tools, communication protocols, and data-sharing agreements between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.

These use cases demonstrate the node’s versatility, enabling users to tackle both current challenges and future opportunities in supply chain management.
